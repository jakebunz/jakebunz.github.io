    "text": "Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani are some of the best players in baseball and definitley the best on the Angels. What you might not know is that the rest of the Angels haven’t done much in supporting their standout stars.\nThe numbers are shocking.\nWins above replacement (WAR), is the stat that was developed to basically show the players contribution to their team. So we will look at WAR for every player in the MLB for this last season.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(scales)\nwar <- read_csv(\"fangraphs-war-leaderboard.csv\")\ntopwar<- war %>%\n  filter(`Total WAR`>3.84)%>%\n  arrange(desc(`Total WAR`))%>%\n  select(Name, `Total WAR`, Team)\n\nangelswar <- topwar %>%\n  filter(Team == \"LAA\")\n\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_bar(\n    data = topwar,\n    aes(x= reorder(Name, `Total WAR`), weight= `Total WAR`), fill= \"grey\") +\n  geom_bar(\n    data = angelswar,\n    aes(x= reorder(Name, `Total WAR`), weight= `Total WAR`), fill= \"red\")+\n  labs(\n    title=\"How good are they actually?\",\n    subtitle = \"Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout are in the top 20 of WAR, but there isn't another Angel until 76.\",\n    x= \"Player Name\",\n    y= \"Total WAR\",\ncaption= \"By: Jake Bunz | Source: FanGraphs\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size= 20, face=\"bold\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\")+\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nShohei finished 2nd in the MLB for WAR this year with Trout closely behind him. Trout missed 40 games this year due to injuries and he still finished in the top 20.\nThis demonstrates how good they are compared to the rest of the league, but how do they stack up with the rest of the Angels?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(scales)\nhittingstats <- read_csv(\"angelsteamhitting.csv\") %>% mutate(Name = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Name)) %>% mutate(Name = gsub(\"\\\\#\", \"\", Name))\nhittingdata <- hittingstats %>%\n  filter(G>1)%>%\n  mutate(ExtraBaseHits= (`2B`+`3B`), Singles = H-ExtraBaseHits) %>% select(Name, Singles, ExtraBaseHits, HR, RBI) %>% pivot_longer(cols=(-Name), names_to=\"Type\", values_to = \"Number\")\n\n\n\nbar1 <- ggplot()+\n  geom_bar(\n    data= hittingdata,\n    aes(x=reorder(Name, Number), weight= Number, fill= Type)\n  )+\n  labs(title = \"Carrying the offense\",subtitle = \"Trout and Ohtani lead the team in producing the most offense in 2022\",\n       x= \"Player Name\",\n       y= \"Ammount\")+\n  coord_flip()+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=14),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\npercentage <- read_csv(\"percentage.csv\")\n\nbar2 <- ggplot()+\n  geom_bar(\n    data= percentage,\n    aes(x= Type, weight=Percent, fill=Name))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"black\",\"red\"))+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  labs(title = \"Percentage of offense\",\n       x=\"\",\n       y= \"Percent\",\ncaption= \"By: Jake Bunz | Source: Baseball Reference\")+\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\nplot_grid(bar1, bar2, ncol = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nThey produce nearly 30% of all major offensive categories on their team. Having nearly a third of all team offense rely on two players isn’t exactly a recipe for success.\nThat’s just offense, let’s look at pitching stats from the Angels starting rotation.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(scales)\npitchingstats <- read_csv(\"anglesteampitching.csv\") %>% mutate(Name = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Name)) %>% mutate(Name = gsub(\"\\\\#\", \"\", Name))\n\nstarters <- pitchingstats %>%\n  filter(GS>8) %>%\n  select(Name, W, L, ERA, IP, SO, WHIP, `SO9`)\n\nstarters %>% gt() %>%\n  tab_header(title = \"Ohtani is the single star in the starting rotation.\",\n             subtitle = \"He leads the team in all major pitching categories.\")%>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %>% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  )%>%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Jake Bunz | **Source:** Baseball Reference\")\n  )%>%\n  tab_style(\n    locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n    style = list(\n      cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n      cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size = 15)\n    )\n  )%>%\n  opt_row_striping()%>%\n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")%>%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color=\"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n    ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Shohei Ohtani\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Ohtani is the single star in the starting rotation.\n    \n    \n      He leads the team in all major pitching categories.\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Name\n      W\n      L\n      ERA\n      IP\n      SO\n      WHIP\n      SO9\n    \n  \n  \n    Shohei Ohtani\n15\n9\n2.33\n166.0\n219\n1.012\n11.9\n    Patrick Sandoval\n6\n9\n2.91\n148.2\n151\n1.339\n9.1\n    Reid Detmers\n7\n6\n3.77\n129.0\n122\n1.209\n8.5\n    Jose Suarez\n8\n8\n3.96\n109.0\n103\n1.248\n8.5\n    Michael Lorenzen\n8\n6\n4.24\n97.2\n85\n1.280\n7.8\n    Noah Syndergaard\n5\n8\n3.83\n80.0\n64\n1.213\n7.2\n  \n  \n    \n      By: Jake Bunz | Source: Baseball Reference\n    \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nShohei is the work horse for the Angels rotation and his numbers put him in elite company at the top of the league. The rest of the starters were no where close to Shohei.\nIf the Angels want to win in the future they can’t just hope Trout and Ohtani pull the team along. They need to find pieces that will support their stars and team as a whole."
