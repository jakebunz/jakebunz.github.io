    "text": "Ever since that day, no other Colts QB has come even close to the high level of quarterback play he gave all Colts fans during his time in Indy. Quarterback Rating (QBR) looks at the total contribution that the player made to the team on a particular play and over the entire season.\nLet’s look at Colts quarterback QBR since 2012 when Andrew Luck was a rookie.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nqbstats <- read_csv(\"qbs.csv\")\ncoltsqbstats <- qbstats %>%\n  filter(Tm == \"IND\" & G>7) %>%\n  select(Player, QBR, Season, G) %>%\n  mutate(PlayerSeason = paste(Player,Season))\nchosenone <- coltsqbstats%>%\n  filter(Player== \"Andrew Luck\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(\n    data= coltsqbstats,\n    aes(x= reorder(PlayerSeason, QBR),\n    weight= QBR\n  ))+\n  geom_bar(\n    data = chosenone, \n    aes(x= reorder(PlayerSeason, QBR),\n    weight= QBR),\n    fill=\"blue\"\n    ) + \n  coord_flip()+\n  labs(\n    x= \"Quarterback\",\n    y= \"QBR\",\n    title = \"Colts Quarterbacks QBR since 2012\",\n    subtitle = \"After Luck retired no QB has been rated higher than him\",\n    caption = \"Source: ProFootball Reference | By: Jake Bunz\")+\n  theme_minimal()+\n theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nNumbers don’t lie. He is by far the best QB they have had since Peyton Manning. He is the only reason the Colts had any success during his time in Indy.\nThe biggest surprise to Luck’s retirement was that it came after his best season on the Colts. He had statistically one of the best seasons in the last nine years.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\n\nqbstats <- read_csv(\"qbs.csv\")\nlucky <- qbstats %>% filter(Player == \"Andrew Luck\" & Season == '2018')\nmanning <- qbstats %>%\n  filter(Yds>5400)\ntopqb <- qbstats %>%\n  filter(Yds > 4500 & TD > 38)\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(data = qbstats, aes(x= Yds, y = TD), color= \"grey\")+\n  geom_point(data = topqb, aes(x= Yds, y = TD), color = \"black\")+\n  geom_point(data = lucky, aes(x= Yds, y = TD), color= \"blue\")+\n  geom_point(data = manning, aes(x= Yds, y = TD), color = \"orange\")+\n  geom_encircle(data=topqb, aes(x=Yds, y=TD), s_shape=.5, expand=.03, colour=\"red\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=4000, y= 45, label=\"Seasons with at least 4500\\n Yds and 38 TD\"), color=\"dark grey\", size=4)+\n  geom_text(aes(x=4800, y=55, label=\"Peyton Manning\"), fontface= \"bold\")+\n  geom_text(aes(x=4100, y=39, label=\"Andrew Luck\"), fontface= \"bold\")+\n  labs(\n    x=\"Passing Yards\", \n    y=\"Touchdowns\", \n    title=\"Quarterback stats from the last 9 seasons\", \n    subtitle=\"Andrew Lucks 2018 season puts him among an elite group of quarterbacks\",\n    caption=\"Source: ProFootball Reference | By Jake Bunz\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\")\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the years after Luck retired, the Colts offense ran the ball more because they cannot trust the quarterback to throw all over the field. The Colts did not have 2000 rushing yards in any season with Luck at quarterback, but the first year after he retired, they had over 2000. They also had 78 rushing TDs in the Luck era and have 66 already in the three seasons after.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\n\nrushing <- c(\"Luck Era\"= 1912, \"Everyone Else\"=2246)\nrushingtd <- c(\"Luck Era\"= 13, \"Everyone Else\"= 19)\n\niron(\n  waffle(rushing/50,\n         rows = 10,\n         xlab = \"1 square = 50 yards\",\n         colors = c(\"black\", \"blue\")) +\n    labs(\n      title= \"The Colts Offensive Shift Post Andrew Luck\",\n      subtitle = \"The Colts averaged more rushing yards and rushing touchdowns in the\\n years since the chosen one retired.\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank()\n  ),\n   waffle(rushingtd,\n         rows = 5,\n         xlab = \"1 square = 1 TD\",\n         colors = c(\"black\", \"blue\")) +\n    labs(caption = \"Source: ProFootballReference | By: Jake Bunz\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Luck’s retirement is a day I will never forget because he was a fantastic QB who was the bright light on a bad team. He will go down as a Colt legend and one of the best players in the NFL. I only wish the Colts front office would quit making me watch the QB clown show every year."
